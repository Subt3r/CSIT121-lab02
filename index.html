            <p>Hello! This is a simple page I made while learning HTML. It was very diffult 
                at the start due to not knowing what each term meant or how to use it, but with each Step
                it became more and more manageable. The start of the process had me very confused, and
                although I am not a pro I do believe the process will get easier with time.
            </p>
